## About the Project

![banner](./banner.jpg)

**Seesaw is used by over 10M teachers, students, and family members every month across more than 75% of schools in the U.S. Your work at Seesaw will have broad reach and meaningful impact.**

Many people like to use dark theme when on websites, but Seesaw doesn't have it as a feature built-in so I added it my self and for you to download. With this handy **Browser Extension** it will change the background to a dark theme to make it easier to see along with other parts of the page. 

Hope you that you enjoy my creation on your computer when using Seesaw

*Note: This extension is not affiliated with Seesaw*
